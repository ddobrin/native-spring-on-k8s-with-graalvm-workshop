# native-spring-on-k8s-with-graalvm-workshop

This repo contains all the materials required for the `Native Spring on K8s with GraalVM` workshop.

The workshop is designed to help Spring Boot developers build new / modernize existing applications using Spring Native and deploy them in Kubernetes. 
Basic knowledge of Spring Boot and Kubernetes is assumed for successful completion.

---

## Context

This content contains sample code supporting the workshop agenda, with a focus on building Native Applications using Spring Native and GraalVM.

The content is organized around a number of independent sections, each with a `README.md` file explaining how to build and run the samples, 
or pointing out areas of interest, for further exploration. 

The content focuses on the following main areas:
* [Prerequisite Software Setup and Validation](setup/README.md) 
* Understanding [GraalVM](graalvm/README.md)
* Building [Spring Native](spring-native/README.md) Applications with GraalVM
* [Best Practices](best-practices/README.md) for designing native-friendly Spring apps and libraries
* [Complete](complete/README.md) Spring Native examples
