# native-spring-on-k8s-with-graalvm-workshop

This repo contains all the materials required for the `Native Spring on K8s with GraalVM` workshop.

The workshop is designed to help Spring Boot developers build new / modernize existing applications using Spring Native and deploying them in Kubernetes. Basic knowledge of Spring Boot and Kubernetes is assumed for succcesful completion.

---------
## Repository layout

This repo contains sample code supporting the workshop agenda, with a focus on building Native Applications using Spring Native and GraalVM.

The content is organized around a number of independent sections, each with a `README.md` file explaining how to build and run the samples or pointing out interesting areas for further exploration.
* [Prerequisite Software Setup and Validation](setup/README.md) 
* Understanding [GraalVM](graalvm/README.md)
* Building [Spring Native](spring-native/README.md) Applications
* [Modernizing](modernize/README.md) an app to use Spring Native
* [Complete](complete/README.md) Spring Native examples

### `Highly recommended:`
Please follow the [environment setup and validation section](setup/README.md) `prior` to the start of the workshop.
