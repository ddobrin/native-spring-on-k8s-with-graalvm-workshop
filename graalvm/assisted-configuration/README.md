# Java Agent-assisted configuration of GraalVM native images

GraalVM native image build makes close world assumptions, which means all the bytecode in the application needs to be observed and analysed at build time.

One area the analysis process is responsible for is to determine which classes, methods and fields need to be included in the executable. The analysis is static, so it might need some configuration to correctly include the parts of the program that use dynamic features of the language.

However, this analysis cannot always completely predict all usages of the Java Reflection, Java Native Interface (JNI), 
Dynamic Proxy objects (java.lang.reflect.Proxy), or class path resources (Class.getResource). 
Undetected usages of these dynamic features need to be provided to the native-image tool in the form of configuration files.

In order to make preparing these configuration files easier and more convenient, GraalVM provides an agent that tracks all usages of dynamic features of an execution on a regular Java VM. 
<br>During execution, the agent interfaces with the Java VM to intercept all calls that look up classes, methods, fields, resources, or request proxy accesses.

This workshop repository can be cloned to your machine as follows:
```shell
> git clone https://github.com/ddobrin/native-spring-on-k8s-with-graalvm
```

**`Full example code is provided for this section !`**

This example sample is relative to the repository root:

## The sample

The agent allows you to create the configuration files, as well as merge freshly generated config files in subsequent runs:
```shell
# create
> java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=META-INF/native-image <Class file|Jar>

# merge in subsequent runs
> java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-merge-dir=META-INF/native-image <Class file|Jar>

> tree META-INF
META-INF
└── native-image
    ├── jni-config.json
    ├── proxy-config.json
    ├── reflect-config.json
    ├── resource-config.json
    └── serialization-config.json

# Note:  serialization-config is a new config file added in GraaLVM 21.0
```
**NOTE**: configurations provided in the `META-INF/native-image folder` or its subfolders are automatically picked up, as long as they are on the CLASSPATH. This is the rationale of instructing the Java agent to write config files into that folder.

For example, classes and methods accessed through the Reflection API need to be configured. There are a few ways in which this can be configured, but the most convenient way is the assisted configuration javaagent.

Let's work through a sample based on `Reflection.java`:
```java
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

class StringReverser {
    static String reverse(String input) {
        return new StringBuilder(input).reverse().toString();
    }
}

class StringCapitalizer {
    static String capitalize(String input) {
        return input.toUpperCase();
    }
}

public class Reflection {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ReflectiveOperationException {
        String className = args[0];
        String methodName = args[1];
        String input = args[2];

        Class<?> clazz = Class.forName(className);
        Method method = clazz.getDeclaredMethod(methodName, String.class);
        Object result = method.invoke(null, input);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

The main method invokes all methods whose names are passed as command line arguments. Run it normally and observe the output:
```shell
> java Reflection StringReverser reverse "what is new"
wen si tahw

> java Reflection StringCapitalizer capitalize "what is new"
WHAT IS NEW
```

As expected, the method `reverse`and `ca[italize` methods were found via reflection.

Let's build a native image out of it:
```shell
> native-image --no-fallback Reflection
```

**NOTE**: *Using `--no-fallback` option indicates to the native image that it should not revert and created a JVM image, in case the native image build would fail. Fallback images are regular JVM images which can be run using the usual `java Reflection` command. 

Run the result and observe in the output that the class StringReverser and StringCapitalizer could not be found, as it was not added to the native image by default
```shell
> ./reflection StringReverser reverse "what is new"
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: StringReverser
	at com.oracle.svm.core.hub.ClassForNameSupport.forName(ClassForNameSupport.java:60)
	at java.lang.Class.forName(DynamicHub.java:1247)
	at Reflection.main(Reflection.java:21)

> ./reflection StringCapitalizer capitalize "what is new"	
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: StringCapitalizer
	at com.oracle.svm.core.hub.ClassForNameSupport.forName(ClassForNameSupport.java:60)
	at java.lang.Class.forName(DynamicHub.java:1247)
	at Reflection.main(Reflection.java:21)	
```

To build a native image with reflective lookup operations, apply the tracing agent to write a configuration file to be later fed into the native image build together. The config file will provide `hints` to the native image builder in terms of classes to be added 

**NOTE**: Writing a complete reflection configuration file from scratch is possible, but tedious.
Therefore, GraalVM provides an agent for the Java HotSpot VM that produces a reflection configuration file by tracing all reflective lookup operations.
It will also record all usages of the Java Native Interface (JNI), Java Reflection, Dynamic Proxy objects (`java.lang.reflect.Proxy`), or class path resources (`Class.getResource`).

You can specify the agent like the following:

create the directory for the configuration:
```shell
> mkdir -p META-INF/native-image
```

**NOTE**: configurations provided in the `META-INF/native-image folder` or its subfolders are automatically picked up, as long as they are on the CLASSPATH.

Run the application:
```shell
# introduce the Java agent
# send the output to the config-output-dir
# created above: META-INF/native-image
> java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=META-INF/native-image Reflection StringReverser reverse "what is new"
```

Explore the created configuration:

```shell
> cat META-INF/native-image/reflect-config.json

[
    {
    "name":"StringReverser",
    "methods":[{"name":"reverse","parameterTypes":["java.lang.String"] }]
    }
]
```

At the time of running another class accessed via reflection, `StringCapitalizer`, we observe that the `capitalize` method can't be found, therefore we must run the app again. 
You can have multiple runs recorded and the config merged while specifying the `native-image-agent=config-merge-dir` option:

```shell
# config-merge-dir = merge the content in that dir with the existing content
> java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-merge-dir=META-INF/native-image Reflection StringCapitalizer capitalize "what is new"

[
    {
    "name":"StringCapitalizer",
    "methods":[{"name":"capitalize","parameterTypes":["java.lang.String"] }]
    },
    {
    "name":"StringReverser",
    "methods":[{"name":"reverse","parameterTypes":["java.lang.String"] }]
    }
]
```

Building the native image now will make use of the provided configuration and configure the reflection for it, covering both StringReverser and StringCapitalizer classes.
```shell
> native-image --no-fallback Reflection
```

Run it and observe the output:
```shell
> ./reflection StringReverser reverse "what is new"
wen si tahw

> ./reflection StringCapitalizer capitalize "what is new"
WHAT IS NEW
```

This is a very convenient way to configure reflection and resources used by the application for building native images.

## Important observation - super-fast start-up time for native images
```shell
# running the JVM version
> time java Reflection StringReverser reverse "what is new"
wen si tahw

real	0m0.102s
user	0m0.094s
sys	0m0.038s

# running the native version
time ./reflection StringReverser reverse "what is new"
wen si tahw

real	0m0.029s
user	0m0.011s
sys	0m0.017s
```
